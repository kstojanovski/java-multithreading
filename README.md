The motivation was to have mnemonic of the multithreading in Java with all keywords, objects, patterns, constructs from my point of view.
The content will be separated into few files:
* Java keywords
* Objects of low level mulithreading programing in Java
* etc.
Sources which this is based on are:
* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/index.html
* https://www.baeldung.com/java-concurrency
