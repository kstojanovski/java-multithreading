# Java Multithreading
The motivation was to have mnemonic of the multithreading in Java with all keywords, objects, patterns, constructs from my point of view.
The content will be separated into few files:
* [Java keywords](./java-keywords.md)
* [Objects of low level mulithreading programing in Java](./objects-low-level.md)
* [Implicit thread-safe objects](./implicit-thread-safe-objects.md)
* [Atomic variables](./atomic-variables.md)
* [Locks](./locks.md)
* Concurrent objects
  * [Collections](./collections.md)
  * [Executors](./executors.md)
  * [Futures](./futures.md)
  * Multithreading concepts
* Streams
* [Patterns](./patterns.md)
